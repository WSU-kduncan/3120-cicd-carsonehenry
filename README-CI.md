# Part 1

## Project Overview

- For this project I am going to be working closely with Docker and Dockerhub. The goal of this would be to successfully create and integrate a Dockerfile with a working container. Inside that container will be webserver files that will operate a working localhost webserver. The reason I am doing this is that containers make the workload portable and compressed. The tools that I will be using are Docker, nginx, and wsl2.
- You install wsl2 by going into command prompt and running wsl -install, and on ubuntu you can check the version of the wsl you are using by `wsl.exe -l -v`
